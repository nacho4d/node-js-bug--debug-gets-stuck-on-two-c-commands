    use Games::Solitaire::Verify::Solution;

    my $verifier = Games::Solitaire::Verify::Solution->new();

    $verifier->verify_solution({ fh => \*STDIN });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a CPAN Perl module that verifies the solutions of various variants
of card Solitaire. It does not aim to try to be a solver for them, because
this is too CPU intensive to be adequately done using perl5 (as of
perl-5.10.0). If you're interested in the latter, look at:

Instead, what Games-Solitaire-Verify does is verify the solutions
and makes sure they are correct.
